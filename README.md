Animation
=========

Overview
--------

Generic animation framework with no dependence on any UI framework.

After due consideration, a kind of philosophy was reached that an animation
framework should be independent from any UI framework if it wants to become
very generic. This animation framework thinks that essential players of
animation are interpolators, animated parameters, time generators and a
mechanism to make these work together, and do not regard UI components as
essential.
